# CS4641_HW2_Randomized_Optimizations

1) All the plots and the code that generates the plots can be found in the plots folder

2) For the first part of the assignment, I used the sklearn library of python and the code that runs the neural net can be found in the folder NeuralNetBackprop along with the dataset. Dependencies for the code are the following:

    - sklearn
    - scipy
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - pandas

I also derived my own NurseryTest.java file using the AbaloneTest.java and this can be found in ABAGAIL/src/opt/test along with the required dataset in the 'nursery2.txt' file.

3) For the second part of the assignment, I used the following problems from ABAGAIL/src/opt/test
    - TravellingSalesmanTest.java
    - FlipFlopTest.java
    - FourPeakTest.java
